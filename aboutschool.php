         <p>Warm Greetings & Hearty Welcome to BMSSS website.</p>

            </h3>
         <p>We, the Sisters of JMJ Congregation, consider "Education as a God given Mission". Being true to the vision of our founder, Rev. Fr. Mathias Wolff SJ., who had a great desire for the education of young girls and boys, we are on track to make a small but momentous difference in the society through our services at Bharat Mata Sr. Sec. School, Naya Raipur. 
         </p> 
         <p> Education is a beacon of light that lights up our life. True Education liberates and broadens vision of life and inspires prosperity. We educate our students to rise up into fully moulded individuals becoming the torchbearers of the future, to wipe out the darkness of ignorance and hatred with undoubted faith by letting their light shine.

      <p>For me education is not merely to make a living but to make young men and women of character, ability and intellect, in possession of moral and ethical values with the ability to make balanced decisions. Like a sculptor who makes sculptures, our educators guide our students in channelizing the resources to cherish their dreams thereby serving the nation.
      </p>
      <p>You are welcome to be regular viewers of our website and do feel free to give your suggestions for the betterment of our School. May Bharat Mata Sr. Sec. School at Naya Raipur grow from strength to strength flourishing, for the greater glory of God, marching onwards in the supreme service of our nation, world and humanity.
